## 👩🏻‍💻 About App
**🏆 [Accepted] WWDC2023 Swift Student Challenge**🏆<br/>
**Feel Hangeul** is about Onomatopoeia, Mimetic words of Hangeul. In the app, I chose 6 Korean words, and introduced their meaning by using animation effect.<br/>

With this app, I wanted people to use 3 senses - sight, hearing and touch - to feel how expressive Hangeul is.<br/>

For the people who don’t know Korean at all, I wanted this app to be a great chance to have interest in Korean. For those who know the language already, I aimed that this app could help them use these expressions naturally when they write or speak in Korean. I just want people to enjoy beautiful Hangeul.
